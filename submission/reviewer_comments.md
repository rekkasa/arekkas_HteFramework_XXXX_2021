# Reviewer 1
## Points
  - Structuring and descriptions are not well organized
  - What is new? If it is the use of OMOP it's not demonstrated
    well (presentation of only one database, no explicit reference
    to OMOP, etc)
  - No explicit reference to the publicly available code until the
    very end of the paper
  - INTRODUCTION
    - Make contributions clear
    - Would be good to write the introduction as a motivation for
      the listed contributions
  - BACKGROUND
    - There is no background section
    - Cover relevant literature (methods, OHDSI, OMOP)
  - MATERIALS AND METHODS
    - Figure 1 is not referenced in the main text. Also it is 
      too schematic and hard to understand. What is its purpose?
    - Define cohorts properly
    - Define the matching process
    - Make the model more structured, e.g. what happens if outcome
      appears after the 2 years? Is there this flexibility?
    - The framework uses a case-control (??) design. Make clear
      that this the desired setting.
    - There should be an `Evaluation` section coming before the
      `Results` section
  - RESULTS
    - The example doesn't demonstrate the power of OMOP
    - Results are demonstrated in multiple figures. What is their
      purpose? Also, refer to figures in the main text
  - DISCUSSION
    - Why use this specific package instead of the alternatives?
    - What makes your framework standardized?
    - At the end of the discussion it is said that a proof of concept 
      was demonstrated. what is the concept? what is the proof? it is 
      said that it is easily applicable and highly informative: in 
      what respect? how is it demonstrated in the paper?
