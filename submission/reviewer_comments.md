# Reviewer 1
## Points
  - Structuring and descriptions are not well organized
  - What is new? If it is the use of OMOP it's not demonstrated
    well (presentation of only one database, no explicit reference
    to OMOP, etc)
  - No explicit reference to the publicly available code until the
    very end of the paper
  - INTRODUCTION
    - Make contributions clear
    - Would be good to write the introduction as a motivation for
      the listed contributions
  - BACKGROUND
    - There is no background section
    - Cover relevant literature (methods, OHDSI, OMOP)
